abstract = "Asymptotic distribution theory is the primary method used
                  to examine the properties of econometric estimators
                  and tests. We present conditions for obtaining
                  cosistency and asymptotic normality of a very
                  general class of estimators (extremum
                  estimators). Consistent asymptotic variance
                  estimators are given to enable approximation of the
                  asymptotic distribution. Asymptotic efficiency is
                  another desirable property then
                  considered. Throughout the chapter, the general
                  results are also specialized to common econometric
                  estimators (e.g. MLE and GMM), and in specific
                  examples we work through the conditions for the
                  various results in detail. The results are also
                  extended to two-step estimators (with
                  finite-dimensional parameter estimation in the first
                  step), estimators derived from nonsmooth objective
                  functions, and semiparametric two-step estimators
                  (with nonparametric estimation of an
                  infinite-dimensional parameter in the first
                  step). Finally, the trinity of test statistics is
                  considered within the quite general setting of GMM
                  estimation, and numerous examples are given."

abstract = {We propose a generalized method of moments (GMM) Lagrange multiplier statistic, i.e., the K statistic, that uses a Jacobian estimator based on the continuous updating estimator that is asymptotically uncorrelated with the sample average of the moments. Its asymptotic χ2 distribution therefore holds under a wider set of circumstances, like weak instruments, than the standard full rank case for the expected Jacobian under which the asymptotic χ2 distributions of the traditional statistics are valid. The behavior of the K statistic can be spurious around inflection points and maxima of the objective function. This inadequacy is overcome by combining the K statistic with a statistic that tests the validity of the moment equations and by an extension of Moreira's (2003) conditional likelihood ratio statistic toward GMM. We conduct a power comparison to test for the risk aversion parameter in a stochastic discount factor model and construct its confidence set for observed consumption growth and asset return series.}

abstract = {This paper develops a general method for constructing exactly similar tests based on the conditional distribution of nonpivotal statistics in a simultaneous equations model with normal errors and known reduced-form covariance matrix. These tests are shown to be similar under weak-instrument asymptotics when the reduced-form covariance matrix is estimated and the errors are non-normal. The conditional test based on the likelihood ratio statistic is particularly simple and has good power properties. Like the score test, it is optimal under the usual local-to-null asymptotics, but it has better power when identification is weak.}
